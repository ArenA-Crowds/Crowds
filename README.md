# Crowds

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook scripts that correspond to the data analysis and the methodology described in this draft [paper](https://github.com/sonjageorgievska/Arena/blob/master/PaperOnSmoothing/draft-31052016.pdf).

Because of the law for privacy preservation we are not allowed to publicly display the data, but provide a description of the data format [here](https://github.com/sonjageorgievska/Crowds/blob/master/density-estimation-version-2.md)

We also provide most of the output generated from the original dataset in the .md files.
